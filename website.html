  <p>Human activities are a factor. Ever since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have raised temperatures, becoming even higher in the poles and as a result, glaciers are rapidly melting, calving off into the sea and retreating on land. The result of the ice shelves melting is that it removes a protection for glaciers because ice shelves protect from large masses of ice to go into the ocean which affects sea level. An obvious thing that causes ice shelves to melting is that there is global warming and when the ice shelves come in tact with warm air created by greenhouse gasses it melts bit by bit.

  <center><h2> Math Portion </h2></center>
  <p>Math: The whole entire volume for 1.335 billion cubic kilometers for all the oceans and when the conger ice shelve melted the volume approximately increased by 39269 cubic kilometers. That is how much approximately the volume rose and also this would lead to more since the glaciers are unprotected.

  <center><h2>Solutions <h2></center>
  <p>Some solutio to stop from ice shelves melting is obviously by stopping the amount of carbon produced and some ways to do that is to recycle, reduce, and other things related to that. There are a lot of information on the internet that you can search up. Another easy way is to spread awareness of this problem and also to present this to solar geoengineers because they are currently doing work related to this by making a climate intervention that artifically reduces solar radiation above ice caps. </p>
